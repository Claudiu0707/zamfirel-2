# Zamfirel 2

Zamfirel 2 is an enhanced version of my first line-following robot, Zamfirel 1. This iteration introduces a dual operating mode: **Driver Mode** and **Line Follower Mode**. Both modes can be controlled via Bluetooth using dedicated commands. 
To operate the car, the user must install the following application, specifically developed for this purpose: [Car Controller App](https://github.com/Claudiu0707/car-controller)


## Driver Mode
In Driver Mode, the user has full manual control of the car. This mode allows the creation of custom circuits and free driving. 
## Line Follower Mode
In Line Follower Mode, the car can autonomously navigate and complete various circuits. Through the same application, the user can calibrate the PID parameters to better adapt the car’s behavior to different track conditions.

**Updates coming soon.**
